<h2>What is the Counterculture?</h2>

<p>As a group the counterculture is a very difficult group to define. It encompasses as lot of different people with different beliefs, ideas and practices. If one was to ask random passerbys on a crowded street, they would likely get a different answer from each person they asked. Even scholars have conflicting ideas on the exact nature of the counterculture. But on thing most people can agree upon was that the counterculture was unsatisfied with mainstream U.S. society, sometimes referred to as Amerikan Death Culture. And though we may not be able to agree on the exact meaning of this group of people, there is a great deal of information we do know, which can be interpreted to form better fitting definitions. The goal of this web page is to present some of this information and give interpretations as to why it is relevant.</p>

<h3>Amerikan Death Culture?</h3>

<p>There have been many theories as to what aspects of the mainstream U.S. culture that the movement was dissatisfied with. Fortunately many participants on the movement have expressed their thoughts on what they falt was wrong with American society. Some felt that U.S. society was  centered around conformity and repression of natural desires. Some disliked the role science and technology was playing in peoples lives. Others felt like the nation was was corrupt and hypocritical in the way it treated it's own citizens and dealt with foreign nations. A few were even opposed to the entire system of labor and money that was put in place. A lot of participants usually agreed with more than one of these things. Regardless of what specific issues an individual hippie may have had with U.S. society the one thing they all shared in common was a desire not just to protest in favor of their cause, but to form alternative social groups in order to put such ideas into practice.</p>
